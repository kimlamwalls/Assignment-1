      <h2>
          The Position
      </h2>
      <p>
        The position of Senior Systems Engineer at a successful emerging game studio working on following up on their first successful release. Overseeing, developing and optimising core features of new game titles. The job would be very technically, cognitively and socially demanding, but also stimulating. Demanding roles like this excite me and intimidate me. The dynamic and ever changing nature of the problem solving required is something that draws me in. Also the workplace culture and values are incredibly important to me and I strongly resonate with the friendly and grateful culture that LoG has for its staff.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2>
          Required Experience
      </h2>
      <p>
        Significant and broad experience within the game development industry. Experience working in a variety of teams, including associated skills of team problem solving, self reliant problem solving and conflict resolution. Well rounded knowledge and experience in a variety of coding environments and industry standards and the ability to apply these skills in creative ways. A healthy and motivated drive for working towards a singular goal in a large team.
      </p>  <br>

      <h2>
          My Experience
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sound Engineering from recording engineer, mixing engineer to mastering. Both in the music industry and documentary filmmaking.
        Videographer and Video Editor as the director and editor of several music videos and multiple documentary style short films.
        Graphic design work on several corporate presentations.
        Farm Work on a small urban farm. Working as part of a team to build and operate garden beds to certain specifications.
    <br>
    <h2>
      My plan
    </h2>
    <p>
      To advance my skill set building towards this goal I can continue to build my IT and group skills while working towards completing a bachelor of IT. When I have the option to, I can favour assignment topics that will help me become more familiar with the kinds of code and problem solving associated with working in the games industry.
      <br>
      I will endeavour to get involved within game development communities locally and online, through several contacts I regularly socialize with, who work within the industry. Sharing side projects with friends and helping them with theirs. During this time and post degree I can look for opportunities for professional development or experience opportunities in the games industry. Such as attending local game developer meetups.
