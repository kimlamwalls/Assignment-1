        Grew up and still reside in Hobart, Tasmania in the shadow of the mountain kunanyi. Background in music, dabbled in formal music education but found it wasn’t for me at the time. Enjoy self-directed learning and getting immersed in different hobbies. Probably the biggest of which, has been rock climbing all around the state.

        I think the origin of my interest in IT came from my father, a photographer who was always optimistic about emerging technologies that could make his work more streamlined. I remember the mysterious sounds and sights of our family PCs with their floppy disk drives and the hassles of navigating the difficulties of dial-up internet. This initial experience instilled in me a sense for the endless possibilities these magic boxes could have in the future. Since my childhood a large part of me has been shaped by the experiences I have had with video games. Alongside this my interest in music has exposed me to a lot of music technology products both hardware and software.

        The choice to return to formal study had been something always in the back of my mind. After several years of prioritising personal pursuits. I found myself looking for some more committed growth that could lead onto some fulfilling skill building and had the potential to grow into a desirable skill as well as a personal hobby. That combined with the format of a more flexible online format seemed to fit well with my current lifestyle.
        <br><br>
        During my studies I hope to learn a broad range of technical skills that will open a lot of doors for my future. But more generally I hope to learn how to effectively operate as part of a team and  become more proficient at communicating. Which is an area I think I have a lot to learn. And will be essential to my learning. In addition to building on skills like digesting larger tasks and growing my ability to break projects down and prioritise and execute larger tasks into more manageable bites.
