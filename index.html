          <h4>Personality Test</h4>
          <p>As expected I am a little further towards the introverted and intuitive spectrum. This reinforces that I need to focus on regular communication and bouncing ideas off others around me to get the most out of a given team task.
            <br>
            This also is likely to have the follow on effect of alleviating any negative self critique and keeping me on task.
            <br> <br>
            While forming a team I hope to discuss these goals of open communication to encourage both others and myself to keep each other honest, focused and keep everyone involved feeling supported.
