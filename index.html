          I grew up and still reside in Hobart, Tasmania in the shadow of the mountain kunanyi. Background in music, dabbled in formal music education but found it wasn’t for me at the time. I enjoy self-directed learning and immersing myself in different hobbies. Probably the biggest of which, has been rock climbing all around the state over the last 4 years.
        <br><br>
        The origin of my interest in IT came from my father, a photographer who was always optimistic about emerging technologies that could make his work more streamlined. I remember the mysterious sounds and sights of our family PCs with their floppy disk drives and the patience required to navigate the mysteries of dial-up internet. This initial experience instilled in me a sense for the endless possibilities these magic boxes could have in the future. Since my childhood, I have been greatly influenced by my experiences with video games. I was always fascinated by the small glimpses of the inner workings you occasionally get when unintended events cause glitches within the game. These glitches and exploits were always very interesting to me, and shaped the way I think about a lot of creative pursuits. Pushing at the edges of the intended rules to see what might come out. I think that a lot of technologies' greatest innovations come from this pattern of thinking, just on the edges of what is currently the norm. Inventions such as the computer mouse and the modern capacitive touch screen. Alongside this affinity for technology my passion for music has exposed me to a lot of music technology products both hardware and software.
        <br><br>
        The choice to return to formal study had been something always in the back of my mind. After several years of prioritising personal pursuits. I found myself looking for a more committed growth opportunity that could lead onto something more long term. That motivation, combined with the format of a more flexible online format seemed to fit well with my current lifestyle.
        <br><br>
        During my studies I hope to learn a broad range of technical skills that will open a lot of doors for my future. Diversity of skill and ability to branch out into a range of fields to serve the purpose of current and changing personal and professional projects would help me satisfy my hunger for new experiences. But more generally I hope to learn how to effectively operate as part of a team and become more proficient at communicating. Which is an area I think I have a lot to learn and will be essential to my learning.
