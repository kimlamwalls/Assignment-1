      <h2>My take on results</h2>
      <p>
        While I think it’s important to take test results like these with a grain of salt as they are only an estimation of one's personality I think they can still have some useful relevance at least initiating some self reflection.       </p>
  <br>
      <p>
        I agree with the learning style test results that pin me as more of a visual learner. I can keep this in mind when laying out tasks by making use of physical notes and diagrams to aid in keeping focus and retaining information.       </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        As expected I am a little further towards the introverted and intuitive spectrum. Possibly prone to being hesitant to share ideas and a little weak in the area of paying close attention to others. This reinforces that I need to focus on regular communication and bouncing ideas off others around me to get the most out of a given team task. This also is likely to have the follow on effect of alleviating any negative self critique and keeping me on task.
        <br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>
        How I can apply this
      </h2>
      <p>
        Something I noticed, especially while answering and reviewing the creativity and learning tests. Is that an individual's actions and by extension personality can be greatly shaped by their mood. And during the test I noted that I would have answered many of the questions differently had I been in a different mood or if I had been asked twelve months ago. I think for me, early efforts made to maintain a positive optimistic outlook, can have a significant effect on outcomes, for both and those around me.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        While forming a team I hope to discuss these goals of open communication to encourage both others and myself to keep each other honest, focused and keep everyone involved feeling supported.
      </p>
