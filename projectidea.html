    Green thumbs is a smart device app based around starting and growing connections surrounding local gardens. It can be used by people who have gardens to find users who might like to join up and contribute their time or resources, perhaps in exchange for food produce. And can be used by those who have a garden or free yard space they might like to share with others to grow food, plants, and friends!
<br><br>
    With the growing knowledge that local communities and connections are just as important as ever for our mental and physical wellbeing. We need to make the most of the widespread technologies like smartphones to connect and encourage people and communities to make connections they might miss out on otherwise.

  “It is essential that urban planners and policy makers respond to the changing trends in residential living and open up the public sphere for community gardening. The health and well-being benefits are undeniable. “

  The data suggest that more than half (52 per cent) of all Australian households are growing some of their own food and a further 13 per cent report they intend to start. Yet despite this high penetration of food gardening, yields are relatively low and there is a high turnover of participation.
