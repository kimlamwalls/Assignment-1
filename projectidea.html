Overview

  <p>
    Green thumbs is a smart device app based around starting and growing connections surrounding local gardens. It can be used by people who have gardens to find users who might like to join up and contribute their time or resources, perhaps in exchange for food produce. And can be used by those who have a garden or free yard space they might like to share with others to grow food, plants, and friends!

  Description
</h2>
With the growing knowledge that local communities and connections are just as important as ever for our mental and physical wellbeing. We need to make the most of the widespread technologies like smartphones to connect and encourage people and communities to make connections they might miss out on otherwise.
There are many studies globally that demonstrate the value to society that community gardening programs bring. The need for food daily is one of the few essentials we all share. Combining these two potential solutions into an easily accessible networking tool, could accelerate the permeation of small scale local garden collaboration around the world.
“It is essential that urban planners and policy makers respond to the changing trends in residential living and open up the public sphere for community gardening. The health and well-being benefits are undeniable. “

The data suggest that more than half (52 per cent) of all Australian households are growing some of their own food and a further 13 per cent report they intend to start. Yet despite this high penetration of food gardening, yields are relatively low and there is a high turnover of participation.

This study shows that there is a large proportion of people with the intention ready. If the barrier for getting started in the garden were just a little bit lower, this could make all the difference. This, combined with the encouragement of local peers could greatly help with the high turnover of participation
