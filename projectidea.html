    Overview
  </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    Green Thumbs is a smart device app based around growing new gardening connections in local communities. It can be used by ‘host gardeners’, who have their own gardens, to find users who would like to join up and contribute their time and resources, perhaps in exchange for food produce. Additionally, it can be used by those who have their own garden or free yard space that they might like to share with others to grow food, plants, and friends!
  </p>

    Description
  </h2>
    <!-- Paragraph 1 !-->
  <p>
    There is increasing awareness of the importance of connecting to our local communities for our mental and physical wellbeing. Therefore we can utilise widespread technologies such as smartphones and social networking to connect and encourage people to make connections they otherwise might not.
  </p>
<br>
    <!-- Paragraph 2 !-->
  <p>
    There are many studies globally that demonstrate the value to society that community gardening programs bring. The need for nutritious food every day is an essential requirement we all share. Combining these two potential solutions into an easily accessible networking tool, could accelerate the permeation of small scale local garden collaboration around the world.
  </p>
<br>
    <!-- Paragraph 3 !-->
    <p class="quote">
      It is essential that urban planners and policy makers respond to the changing trends in residential living and open up the public sphere for community gardening. The health and well-being benefits are undeniable. (Thompson, Corkery & Judd 2007, p.170)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      A 2014 study on community food gardening found that
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="quote">
        more than half (52 per cent) of all Australian households are growing some of their own food and a further 13 per cent report they intend to start. Yet despite this high penetration of food gardening, yields are relatively low and there is a high turnover of participation’ (Wise 2014, p.19).
    </p>
<br>
<p>
  From Wise’s study we can conclude that there is a large number of people who have ample motivation and intention to grow their own food (Wise 2014) . However, there are barriers between these intentions and their implementation, which may include social conflict and frequent turnover (Tharrey, Sachs & Perignon 2020). Therefore if these social barriers were overcome we could see significant increases in successful community gardening. We can overcome these barriers by providing a networking tool to increase the support and education of first-time and long-time gardeners alike.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  This issue was also observed by Tharrey, Sachs & Perignon (2020). In their study community gardens were introduced to a lower socio economic group with no previous gardening experience. The study demonstrated that the community gardens suffered due to high turnover of participation, and concluded that this was the result of conflicts between gardeners as well as gardeners having a lack of time to contribute.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Hopefully by design, this app will allow community efforts to be more successful. It is targeted towards small scale collaborations, promoting communal support of those in the community with varied experience in gardening and a willingness to share. Users will be able to share and discuss motivations, expectations and desired outcomes as part of the networking process. They will have ownership of their individual projects, rather than adhering to the protocols of a larger organisation.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  In addition to social benefits, community gardening has environmental benefits through reducing carbon emission food miles. With a return to local produce becoming a norm, there is less waste and carbon emissions from packaging and transport required to ship foods around the globe.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  With people becoming more closely connected to the foods they eat, this in turn brings about better awareness of diet. A meta-analysis by Soga, Gaston & Yamaura found that ‘gardening can improve physical, psychological, and social health’ (2016, p. 98). They noted that ‘With an increasing demand for reduction of health care costs worldwide our findings have important policy implications.’ and that gardening could ‘alleviate and prevent various health issues facing today's society’ (Soga, Gaston & Yamaura 2016, p. 98). These dietary, physical and mental health benefits should be worthy of significant attention from the government as they have the potential to greatly improve people's lives and reduce burdens on public healthcare systems.
</p>

<h2>
What would this app look like?
</h2>
<p>
  Green Thumbs will take the form of an easy to use mobile app. With a user interface consisting of personal and garden profiles and the ability to browse other users’ profiles. Users' specific location and personal details are protected until both users communicate and consent. Profiles will have a name, profile picture, “about me” and “looking for” sections. The app will have an instant messaging system for individual users and groups to connect. The application can also include educational content such as videos on composting, planting times for different crops, or any other content that promotes topical discussion.
</p>
<h2>
  Tools Required
</h2>
<br>
<p>
  Smartphones and tablets, now being so widespread, provide an incredible resource for networking peers. Of high importance for this application would be user interface design and simplicity of operation. Design software such as Adobe Illustrator will be required. This along with branding, would be essential for the application to achieve its goal of accessibility and widespread use. A careful trial and evaluation of each feature would be needed to keep the application simple and user friendly. For apple product development Xcode would be used, and Android Studio used for android development. Along with other development environments options such as unity.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
  Skills Required
</h2>
<br>
<p>
  Skills required include a variety of programming and design skills for developing mobile applications, C, Swift, C# and Java. As well as research and development in: managing secure user accounts and profiles, location tracking, potentially implementation of maps, user interface design. Iterative user testing and revision of features.
</p>
<h2>
  Outcome
</h2>
<br>
<p>
This initiative will provide a simple platform for networking small scale local gardening communities. Although there are currently many community gardens throughout the world, there is always room for more. For current gardeners the social support and networking opportunities have the potential to increase longevity and productivity. This simple and accessible tool could have a significant impact on the permeation and social sustainability of local and communal gardening culture.
