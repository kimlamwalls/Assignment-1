    Overview
  </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    Green Thumbs is a smart device app based around growing new gardening connections in local communities. It can be used by ‘host gardeners’, who have their own gardens, to find users who would like to join up and contribute their time and resources, perhaps in exchange for food produce. Additionally, it can be used by those who have their own garden or free yard space that they might like to share with others to grow food, plants, and friends!

    Description
  </h2>
  <p>
    There is increasing awareness of the importance of connecting to our local communities for our mental and physical wellbeing. Therefore we can utilise widespread technologies such as smartphones and social networking to connect and encourage people to make connections they otherwise might not.

This study shows that there is a large proportion of people with the intention ready. If the barrier for getting started in the garden were just a little bit lower, this could make all the difference. This, combined with the encouragement of local peers could greatly help with the high turnover of participation

  “It is essential that urban planners and policy makers respond to the changing trends in residential living and open up the public sphere for community gardening. The health and well-being benefits are undeniable. “

  The data suggest that more than half (52 per cent) of all Australian households are growing some of their own food and a further 13 per cent report they intend to start. Yet despite this high penetration of food gardening, yields are relatively low and there is a high turnover of participation.
